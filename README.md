Capstone Project Overview

Project Purpose


This projectâ€™s purpose is to leverage my knowledge and skills and apply them
to a start-up e-commerce information technology infrastructure. As part of this integrated
effort, I identified the hardware and software components of the e-commerce
infrastructure, developed infrastructure design and implementation plans, and summarized my
learnings in an executive presentation to potential investors.

Background Information
